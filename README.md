# netcdf2json
Convert netCDF output to JSON for use in earth:  http://earth.nullschool.net https://github.com/cambecc/earth  https://gitlab.ecosystem-modelling.pml.ac.uk/pica/earth

This project was to scratch an itch and isn't really all that ready for general consumption. I'd suggest using the modified ncdump utility here instead: https://github.com/jllodra/ncdump-json
